# DensityHeatMap
Basic density heat mapping in R using GPS coordinates.  

This is the basic R code that I used to create crash density mapping while working in traffic safety analytics field.  It requires a CSV file with GPS coordinates for the points of interest.

Much of the basis behind this code came from http://www.exegetic.biz/blog/2013/12/contour-and-density-layers-with-ggmap/ where you can find an excellent example of using contour and density layers with lightning strike data.

To extend the functionality of this code, a more advanced density scoring analysis will be added in which the density score at a pariticular point can be extracted.  This readme will be updated with a reference to the link when available.
